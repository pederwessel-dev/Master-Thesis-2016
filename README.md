Oslo, 13th of august 2019

I made this code for the purpose of writing a master thesis about validating a forest model in wind simulation. 
Because of time constraints and I did not prioritize to write documentaton in the codes or modularize it either. 
So from a software engineering perspective the code is very messy. Especially the filtering code was extremely slow because
of all the combinations of two met masts that was evaluated.

The code was customized for a dataset provided by Statkraft and is therefore not very easy to generalize.
I only had about 3 months to finish the thesis. But if you're interested in knowing more about the code let me.

Kind regards,
Peder Wessel
